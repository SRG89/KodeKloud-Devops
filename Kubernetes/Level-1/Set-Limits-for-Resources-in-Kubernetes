# Problem Statement
#
# Recently some of the performance issues were observed with some 
# applications hosted on Kubernetes cluster.The Nautilus DevOps team 
# has observed some resources constraints, where some of the applications 
# are running out of resources like memory, cpu etc.and some of the 
# applications are consuming more resources than needed.Therefore, 
# the team has decided to add some limits for resources utilization.
@ Below you can find more details.
#
#
# Create a pod named httpd-pod and a container under it named as 
# httpd-container, use httpd image with latest tag only and remember 
# to mention tag i.e httpd:latest and set the following limits:
#
# Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m
# Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m
#
# Solution Script
#
# run a dry-run to manifest the yaml file for resource pod
kubectl run httpd-pod --image=httpd:latest --dry-run=client -o yaml > app.yaml
# edit the yaml file with specification as mentioned in task
vi app.yaml
cat app.yaml
#---------------------------------
# Yaml file after adding resources
#
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: httpd-pod
  name: httpd-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: httpd:latest
    name: httpd-container
    resources: 
      requests:
        memory: "15Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "20Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
#-----------------------------------------------------
#
# create resource pod from manifested file
kubectl create -f app.yaml
# validate the task by listing the resource pod
kubectl get po -o wide
