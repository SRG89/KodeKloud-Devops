# deployment on Kubernetes platform as they are planning to migrate most 
# of their applications on Kubernetes platform.Recently one of the team 
# members has been assigned a task to create a pod as per details 
# mentioned below:
#
# Create a pod named pod-httpd using httpd image with latest tag only 
# and remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest.
# Labels app should be set to httpd_app,also container should be named 
# as httpd-container.

kubectl run pod-httpd --image=httpd:latest --dry-run=client -o yaml > app.yaml
# edit the yaml file
