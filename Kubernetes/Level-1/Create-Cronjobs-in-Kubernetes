# Problem Statement
#
#
# There are some jobs/tasks that need to be run regularly on different 
# schedules.Currently the Nautilus DevOps team is working on developing 
# some scripts that will be executed on different schedules,but for the 
# time being the team is creating some cron jobs in Kubernetes cluster 
# with some dummy commands (which will be replaced by original scripts later).
# Create a cronjob as per details given below:
#
#
#
# Create a cronjob named devops.
# Set Its schedule to something like */12 * * * *, you set any schedule 
# for now.Container name should be cron-devops.
# Use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag 
# i.e nginx:latest.
# Run a dummy command echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!.
# Ensure restart policy is OnFailure.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# create yaml file for resource cronjob
vi cron.yaml
cat cron.yaml
#---------------------------------------------
# Following is the yaml file for cron job
#
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: devops
spec:
  schedule: "*/12 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: cron-devops
            image: nginx:latest
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
#--------------------------------------------------------
#
# create resource cronjob from above yaml file
kubectl create -f cron.yaml
# validate the task by listing resource cronjob
kubectl get cronjob -o wide
