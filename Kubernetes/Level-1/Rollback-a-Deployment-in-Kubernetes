# Problem Statement
#
# This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for 
# one of the applications. Recently one of the customers logged a 
# complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release.
# Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.
#
# There is a deployment named nginx-deployment;roll it back to the 
# previous revision
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# check the current version of the application image
kubectl get deploy -o wide
# run the cli for rolling back
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# another method is to first check the rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/<name-of-deployment>
# rollback to a specific revision by specifying it with --to-revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=<revision-num>
