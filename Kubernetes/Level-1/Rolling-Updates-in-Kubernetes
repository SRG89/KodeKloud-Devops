# Problem Statement
#
# We have an application running on Kubernetes cluster using nginx 
# web server.The Nautilus application development team has pushed some 
# of the latest changes and those changes need be deployed.The Nautilus 
# DevOps team has created an image nginx:1.19 with the latest changes.
#
# Perform a rolling update for this application and incorporate 
# nginx:1.19 image.The deployment name is nginx-deployment
#
# Make sure all pods are up and running after the update.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# run the cli for the rolling update[Note: nginx-container is the name of 
# deployed container]
kubectl set image deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.19# validate the task by checking the resource deployment
kubectl get deploy -o wide
# Another method is to manifest the yaml file
kubeclt get deploy<deployment-name> -o yaml > deploy.yaml
# edit the deploy.yaml file with image suggested in task
vi deploy.yaml
# re-deploy application with new updated image
kubectl replace -f deploy.yaml --force
# validate the task by listing the resource deployment
kubectl get deploy -o wide
