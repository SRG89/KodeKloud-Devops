# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is going to deploy some applications on 
# kubernetes cluster as they are planning to migrate some of their 
# existing applications there.Recently one of the team members has 
# been assigned a task to write a template as per details mentioned below:
#
# Create a ReplicaSet using httpd image with latest tag only and 
# remember to mention tag i.e httpd:latest and name it as httpd-replicaset.
#
# Labels app should be httpd_app,labels type should be front-end.
# The container should be named as httpd-container;also make sure 
# replicas counts are 4.
#
# Solution Script
#
# manifest the yaml file for resource deployment
kubectl create deploy httpd-replicaset --image=httpd:latest --replicas=4 
--dry-run=client -o yaml > deployment.yaml
# edit the manifested yaml file to create resource replicaset
vi deployment.yaml
cat deployment.yaml

      - image: httpd:latest
        name: httpd-container
#------------------------------------------------------
#
# create a resource replicaset from yaml file
