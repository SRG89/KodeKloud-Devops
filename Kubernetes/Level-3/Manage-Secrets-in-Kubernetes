# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy some tools in Kubernetes 
# cluster.Some of the tools are licence based so that licence information 
# needs to be stored securely within Kubernetes cluster.Therefore,the 
# team wants to utilize Kubernetes secrets to store those secrets.
# Below you can find more details about the requirements:
#
# We already have a secret key file beta.txt under /opt location on jump host.
# Create a generic secret named beta,it should contain the 
# password/license-number present in beta.txt file.
#
# Also create a pod named secret-xfusion.
#
# Configure pod's spec as container name should be secret-container-xfusion,
# image should be fedora preferably with latest tag (remember to mention 
# the tag# with image).Use sleep command for container so that it remains 
# in running state.Consume the created secret and mount it under /opt/apps
# within the container.
#
# To verify you can exec into the container secret-container-xfusion,to check 
# the secret key under the mounted path /opt/apps.Before hitting the Check 
# button please make sure pod/pods are in running state,also validation can 
# take some time to complete so keep patience.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# Create generic secret as instructed in task 
kubectl create secret generic beta --from-file=/opt/beta.txt
# manifest yaml file for resource pod
kubectl run secret-xfusion --image=fedora:latest --dry-run=client -o yaml > app.yaml
# edit yaml file as instructed in task
vi app.yaml
cat app.yaml
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# content of yaml file

 #--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 #
 # create resource pod from yaml file
 kubectl create -f app.yaml
 # validate the task by checking the secret key under 
 # the mounted path /opt/apps within container secret-container-xfusion
 kubectl exec -it secret-xfusion -c secret-container-xfusion -- /bin/bash
 ls -l -h /opt/apps | grep beta.txt
