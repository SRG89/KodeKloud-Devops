# The Nautilus DevOps team want to deploy a PHP website on Kubernetes cluster.
# They are going to use Apache as a web server and Mysql for database.The team 
# had already gathered the requirements and now they want to make this website 
# live. Below you can find more details:
#
#
#
#
# Create a config map php-config for php.ini with variables_order = "EGPCS" data#
# Create a deployment named lamp-wp.
#
# Create two containers under it. First container must be httpd-php-container 
# using image webdevops/php-apache:alpine-3-php7 and second container must be 
# mysql-container from image mysql:5.6.Mount php-config configmap in httpd 
# container at /opt/docker/etc/php/php.ini location.
#
# Create kubernetes generic secrets for mysql related values like myql root 
# password, mysql user, mysql password, mysql host and mysql database.Set 
# any values of your choice.
#
# Add some environment variables for both containers:
# MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD and 
# MYSQL_HOST.Take their values from the secrets you created.Please make 
# sure to use env field (do not use envFrom) to define the name-value pair 
# of environment variables.
#
#
# Create a node port type service lamp-service to expose the web application, 
# nodePort must be 30008.
#
#
# Create a service for mysql named mysql-service and its port must be 3306.
#
#
# We already have /tmp/index.php file on jump_host server.
#
#
# Copy this file into httpd container under Apache document root i.e /app 
# and replace the dummy values for mysql related variables with the environment # variables you have set for mysql related parameters. Please make sure you do 
# not hard code the mysql related details in this file, you must use the 
# environment variables to fetch those values.
#
# You must be able to access this index.php on node port 30008 at the end,
# please note that you should see Connected successfully message while 
# accessing this page.
