# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for 
# an application that will send the greetings to different users.There is 
# a sample deployment, that needs to be tested.Below is a scenario which 
# needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster.Please find below more 
# details about it.
#
#
# Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.
#
# Configure spec as,the container name should be print-env-container 
# and use bash image.
#
# Create three environment variables:
# 
#
# a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to
# b. COMPANY and its value should be Stratos
# c. GROUP and its value should be Industries
#
# Use command ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"'] 
# (please use this exact command),also set its restartPolicy policy to 
# Never to avoid crash loop back.
#
# Solution Script
#
# manifest yaml file for resource pod
kubectl run print-envars-greeting --image=bash --dry-run=client -o yaml > greet.yaml
# edit yaml file as instructed in task
vi greet.yaml
cat greet.yaml
