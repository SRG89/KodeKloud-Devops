# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus application development team has shared that 
# they are planning to deploy one newly developed application 
# on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL 
# database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL 
# database server as per requirements shared below:
#
#
#
#PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus 
#database server.
#
#
# a. Create a database user kodekloud_roy and set its password to 8FmzjvFU6S.
# b. Create a database kodekloud_db6 and grant full permissions to user 
#    kodekloud_roy on this database.
#
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to the database server
ssh peter@stdb01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# check the status of the postgres
systemctl status postgresql
# connect to PostgreSQL using psql
psql -U postgres
# check the list of users on the database
\du
# create a user as mentioned in the task
CREATE USER kodekloud_roy WITH PASSWORD '8FmzjvFU6S';
# create a database
CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db6;
# grant all privileges on newly created database
# for user kodekloud_roy
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "kodekloud_db6" to kodekloud_roy;
# exit the postgres
\q
# Note: we create kodekloud_db6 database with postgres rolename/user.
# However, if we want to create database with different user then 
# we have to add appropriate attributes for that role/user.
# For example we want to create database with user kodekloud_roy 
# then we need to add attibute for that user
ALTER USER kodekloud_roy CREATEDB;
# This will add new attribute for user kodekloud_roy and thus
# make user able to create the database.
