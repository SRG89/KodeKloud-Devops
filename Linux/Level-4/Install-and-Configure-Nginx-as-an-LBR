# Problem Statement:
#
# Day by day traffic is increasing on one of the websites managed by the 
# Nautilus production support team.Therefore,the team has observed a 
# degradation in website performance. Following discussions about 
# this issue,the team has decided to deploy this application on a 
# high availability stack i.e on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC.
# They started the migration last month and it is almost done, 
# as only the LBR server configuration is pending. Configure LBR server 
# as per the information given below:
#
#
#
# a. Install nginx on LBR (load balancer) server.
# b. Configure load-balancing with the an http context 
#    making use of all App Servers.
# c. Also make sure Apache service is up and running on all app servers.
# d. Once done, you can access the website using StaticApp 
#    button on the top bar.
#
# Solution Script
#
# access to load balancer server
ssh loki@stlb01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#install nginx
yum install nginx -y 
#configure nginx config file
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
#verify the added content of the nginx config file
cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
#----------------------------------------------------------------
#
#we have added three application server under upstream 
#backend and use it to set the proxy_pass 
upstream backend {
          server stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:6300;

}

        root         /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

        location / {
          proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
}
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# restart the service
systemctl restart nginx
# validate the task by accessing the web content from jump host
# via proxy server(load-balancer) at port 80
