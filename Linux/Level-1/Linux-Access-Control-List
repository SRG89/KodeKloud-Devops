# Problem Statement:
#
#The Nautilus security team performed an audit on all servers present in Stratos DC. 
#During the audit some critical data/files were identified which were having the wrong permissions as per security standards. 
#Once the report was shared with the production support team, they started fixing the issues one by one. 
#It has been identified that one of the files named /etc/resolv.conf on Nautilus App 1 server has wrong permissions, 
#so that needs to be fixed and the correct ACLs needs to be set.
#
#1. The user owner and group owner of the file should be root user.
#
#2. Others must have read only permissions on the file.
#
#3. User siva must not have any permission on the file.
#
#4. User rod should have read only permission on the file.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access to application server one using ssh command
ssh tony@stapp01
# get the current permission of the file using setfacl command
getfacl /etc/resolv.comf
# grant the additioal permission to individual user using setfacl command
setfacl -m u:siva:--- /etc/resolv.conf
setfacl -m u:rod:r-- /etc/resolv.conf
# check the newly granted permission 
getfacl /etc/resolv.conf
