# Problem Statement:
#
#After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security 
#team has implemented some new security policies.One of them is to disable direct 
#root login through SSH.
#
#Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
#access all three application servers using ssh command. 
#We are only providing the solution for application server one.
#
ssh tony@stapp01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#find the sshd_config file using find command
find /etc/ -type f -name sshd_config
#change the access modes of the file sshd_config
chmod 777 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#set PermitRootLogin to 'no' from 'yes' using sed command
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#restart the sshd.service
systemctl restart sshd
