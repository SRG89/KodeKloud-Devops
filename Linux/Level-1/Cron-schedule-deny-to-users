# Problem Statement
#
#
#To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions 
#on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. 
#Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 2.
#
#Allow crontab access to yousuf user and deny the same to ryan user.
#
# Solution Script
#
# access application server using ssh command
ssh steve@stapp02
# provide crontab access user yousuf 
echo 'yousuf' > /etc/cron.allow
# Deny crontab access to user ryan
echo 'ryan' > /etc/cron.deny
