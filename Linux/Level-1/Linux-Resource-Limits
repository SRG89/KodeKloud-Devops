# Problem Statement:
#
#On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, 
#which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. 
#Please set its maximum process limits as below:
#
# a. soft limit = 1024
# b. hard_limit = 2025
#
# Solution Script
#
# accesss storage server using ssh command
ssh natasha@ststor01
# find the location of limits.conf file
find /etc/ -type f -name limits.conf
# within limits.conf file add the following
nfsuser          soft    nproc           1024
nfsuser          hard    nproc           2025
# This will limit the number of processes nfsuser can hold.
