# Problem Statement:
#
# There are specific access levels for users defined by the xFusionCorp Industries system admin team. 
# Rather than providing access levels to every individual user, the team has decided to create groups 
# with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed.See the following requirements:
#
# (a) Create a group named nautilus_sftp_users in all App servers in Stratos Datacenter.
# (b) Add the user stark to nautilus_sftp_users group in all App servers.(create the user if doesn't exist)
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
#
#access application server using ssh command.We are only showing solution for application server one.
#
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
#create group
groupadd nautilus_sftp_users
# check the user using id command and create if doesn't exist
id stark
useradd stark -g nautilus_sftp_users
#check the created group using cat command
cat /etc/group | grep nautilus_sftp_users
#check the added user and group using id command
id stark
