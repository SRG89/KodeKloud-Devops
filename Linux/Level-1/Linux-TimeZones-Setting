# Problem Statement:
#
#During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter 
#doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is Pacific/Norfolk.
#
#
#Correct the mismatch.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#access all three application servers using ssh command. We are only showing solution for server one.
ssh tony@stapp01
#get the current time zone using timedatectl command
timedatectl | grep 'Time zone'
#set the Pacific/Norfolk time-zone on all application servers
timedatectl set-timezone Pacific/Norfolk
