# Problem Statement:
#
# For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use 
# custom Apache users for each web application hosted,rather than its default
# user.This will be the Apache user,so it shouldn't use the default home directory. 
# Create the user as per requirements given below:
#
# a. Create a user named siva on the App server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
# b. Set its UID to 1758 and home directory to /var/www/siva.

#Solution Script:
#
#access application server 2 using ssh and then create the user
ssh steve@stapp02
sudo useradd siva -u 1758 -d /var/www/siva
# check the user using id command
id siva
# check the home directory using cat command
cat /etc/passwd | grep siva
