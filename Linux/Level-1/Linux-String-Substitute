# Problem Statement:
#
#The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application.
#However,these template XML files must be populated with valid data before they can be used.
#One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries is to apply 
#string and file manipulation commands!
#
#
#
#
#Replace all occurances of the string Sample to Echo-Location on the XML file 
#/root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
#access storage server using ssh command
ssh clint@stbkp01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#count the occurance of string 'Sample' using cat and wc command
cat /root/nautilus.xml | grep -o Sample | wc -l
#replace the string 'sample' using sed command 
sed -i 's/Sample/Echo-Location/g' /root/nautilus.xml
#again count the occurance of string 'Sample' using cat and wc command
cat /root/nautilus.xml | grep -o Sample | wc -l
#If the recount of string 'Sample' return 0 then job is completed.
