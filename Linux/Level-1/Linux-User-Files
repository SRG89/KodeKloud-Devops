# Problem Statement:
#
#There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 1 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. 
#Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there.
#Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. 
#Find the details below:

#On App Server 1 find all files (not directories) owned by user kirsty inside /home/usersdata directory and 
#copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /news directory.
#
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#access application server one with ssh command
#
#
ssh tony@stapp01
#
#find the files owned by user kirsty and copy them to destination folder 
#using find command while keeping parent directory intact.
find /home/usersdata/ -type f -user kirsty -exec cp --parent {} /news\;
#count the number of transfer files using ls and wc command 
ls -l -h /news/home/usersdata | wc -l
