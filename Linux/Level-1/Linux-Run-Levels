# Problem Statement:
#
#New tools have been installed on the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
#Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface.
#Therefore, there are some requirements for these app servers as below.
#
#
#On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter, change the default runlevel so that 
#they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default. 
#Please do not try to reboot these servers after completing this task.
#
# Solution Script:
#
#access all application servers using ssh command.We are only showing 
#solution for application one server.
ssh tony@stapp01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#check the default target using systemctl command
systemctl get-default
#set graphical target as default target
systemctl set-default graphical.target
