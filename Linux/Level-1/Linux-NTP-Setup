#The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter
#where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted.
#To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers.
#They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 1.Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:
#
#
#1.Install and configure NTP server on App Server 1.
#2.Add NTP server 1.africa.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 1.
#3.Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a 
#restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes 
#to be applied right now.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to application one server using ssh command
ssh tony@stapp01
# update yum package
yum update
# install ntp server
yum install ntp
# start and enable ntp
systemctl start ntpd
systemctl enable ntpd
#configure ntp.conf file and add the following line
server 1.africa.pool.ntp.org iburst
#restart ntpd service again
systemctl restart ntpd
