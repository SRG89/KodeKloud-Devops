# Problem Statement:
#
#
# A developer named kareem has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. 
# As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for kareem. 
# Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to 
# access servers beyond that point.
#
# Therefore,create a user named kareem on the App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. 
# Set expiry date to 2021-04-15.Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# access application server 3 using ssh command
#
ssh banner@stapp03
#
sudo su -
#
#
useradd kareem -e 2021-04-15
