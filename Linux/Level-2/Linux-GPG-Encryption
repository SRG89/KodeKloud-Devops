# Problem Statement
#
#We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location,so
#we need to encrypt that data. We also need to decrypt data we received from a
#remote location in order to understand its content.
#
#
#On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored at /home/*_key.asc. Use these keys to perform the following actions.
#
#
#
#
# Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
#
#
#
#
# Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt.
# (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud)
#
#
#
# The user ID you can use is kodekloud@kodekloud.com
#
#
#
#  Solution Script
#
#
#
#  access the storage server using ssh
ssh natasha@ststor01
# check the gpg tool into the system
gpg --version
# import public and private key using gpg
gpg --import /home/public_key.asc
gpg --import /home/private_key.asc
# list the imported public and private keys
gpg --list-keys
gpg --list-secret-keys
# encrypt the provided .txt file
gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armor < /home/encrypt_me.txt -o /home/encrypted_me.asc
# decrypt the provided .asc file
gpg --decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc > /home/decrypted_me.txt
