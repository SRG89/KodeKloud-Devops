# Problem Statement:
#
#The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. 
#They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. 
#Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. 
#Therefore, perform the steps below:
#
#a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.
#b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.
#
# Solution Script
#
# access all application server. We are only showing solution for server one
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# uodate the yum package manager and install the cronie
yum update
yum install -y cronie
# start the crond and reload the daemon
systemctl start crond
systemctl daemon-reload
#list the cron jobs for root user
crontab -l
#edit the crontab for root user
crontab -e
# add a following cron for the root user for task completion
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
