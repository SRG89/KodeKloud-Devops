# Problem Statement:
#
#During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner.
#The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance.
#These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.
#
#
#Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus.
#Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access all application and database servers.We are only showing solution for database server
ssh peter@stdb01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# check the current message of the day using cat command
cat /etc/motd
# change the access privilege of the motd file
chmod 777 /etc/motd
# From the jump server transfer the message template into database server
scp ~/nautilus_banner peter@stdb01:/etc/motd
# switch back to database server and check the updated message
cat /etc/motd
