# Problem Statement
#
#The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named ecommerce_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2).



#a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip of 
#   /var/www/html/ecommerce directory.


#b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. 
#   This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location 
#   will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to 
#   save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.


#c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server 
#   in /backup/ location.


#d. Please make sure script won't ask for password 
#   while copying the archive file. Additionally, the 
#   respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) 
#   must be able to run it.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
#access to the application server two
ssh steve@stapp02
# create a script file to execute the above mentioned task
vi /scripts/ecommerce_backup.sh
# view the content of script using cat command
cat /scripts/ecommerce_backup.sh
#----------------------------------------------------------------

!/bin/bash

zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip /var/www/html/ecommerce
scp /backup/xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup/
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#To make password less coonection with backupserver generate 
#pair of private and public keys
ssh-keygen
#copy the public key to backup server
ssh-copy-id clint@stbk01
# execute the script
bash /scripts/ecommerce_backup.sh
# ssh into the backupserver and check the zip archive
ssh clint@stbk01
ls -l -h /backup/ | grep xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip
