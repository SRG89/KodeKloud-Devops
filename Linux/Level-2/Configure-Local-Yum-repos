# Problem Statement:
#
#The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to 
#use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. 
#For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. 
#This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository 
#on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.
#
#a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.
#b. Create a yum repo named epel_local and make sure to set Repository ID to epel_local. 
#   Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.
#c. Install package samba from this newly created repo.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to backup server using ssh
ssh clint@stbkp01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#check the current repos using ls command
ls -l /etc/yum.repos.d
#create the new repo within yum.repos.d directory
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/epel_local.repo
#check the content of newely created repo file with cat command
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/epel_local.repo
#-----------------------------------
#[epel_local]
#name=epel_local
#baseurl= file:////packages/downloaded_rpms/
#enabled=1
#gpgcheck=0
#-----------------------------------
#list the newly created repo
yum repolist
# install the samba package
yum install samba
# check the installation of package within created repo
yum list samba
