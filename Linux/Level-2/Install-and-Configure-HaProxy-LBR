# Problem Statement;
#
#There is a static website running in Stratos Datacenter.
#They have already configured the app servers and code is 
#already deployed there.To make it work properly, they need 
#to configure LBR server.There are number of options for that, 
#but team has decided to go with HAproxy.
#FYI, apache is running on port 5004 on all app servers. 
#Complete this task as per below details.
#
#
#a.Install and configure HAproxy on LBR server using yum only and 
#  make sure all app servers are added to HAproxy load balancer. 
#  HAproxy must serve on default http port (Note: 
#  Please do not remove stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats entry 
#  from haproxy default config.).
#
#b.Once done, you can access the website using StaticApp button on the top bar.
#
# Solution Script:
#
# check the content of app running in the application servers using curl
curl stapp01:5004; curl stapp02:5004; curl stapp03:5004;
# access the load balancer server
ssh loki@stlb01
# switch to the root user
sudo su -
# install haproxy using yum
yum install -y haproxy
# start and enable haproxy
systemctl start && enable haproxy
# find the path of the haproxy configuration file
find /etc/ -type f -name haproxy.cfg
# configure the haproxy file
vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
#--------------------------------------------
#frontend main
    bind *:80 # This need to be chaged to
              # default http port(i.e.80)

#Now we need to simply add backend app server
#
#backend app
    balance     roundrobin
    server  app1 stapp01:5004 check
    server  app2 stapp02:5004 check
    server  app3 stapp03:5004 check
#---------------------------------------------
#restart the haproxy
systemctl restart haproxy
# using netstat get the listening port for haproxy
netstat -nap | grep LISTEN
#If haproxy is exposed at default httpd port then access
#the content of applications server using curl command
curl http://localhost:80
