# Problem Statement:
#There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC.
#The production support team identified that the application is unable to 
#connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found 
#that mariadb service is down on the database server.
#
#
#
#Look into the issue and fix the same.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to the dabase server
ssh peter@stdb01
# start the mariadb-server
systemctl start mariadb
# If it fails then run journalctl
journalctl -u mariadb -f
#From journalctl following error detected:
'Error: Cant create test file /var/lib/mysql/stdb01.lower-test'
#Error suggest the permission need to be updated 
chown mysql -R /var/lib/mysql
chmod 777 /var/lib/mysql
# restart the mariadb
systemctl restart mariadb
