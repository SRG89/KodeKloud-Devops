# Problem Statement:
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, 
# which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
# They are expecting significant traffic/usage of tomcat on app servers 
# after that. This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. 
# To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log 
# files and need to rotate old logs. Check the requirements shared below:
#
#
# a. In all app servers install tomcat package.
# b. Using logrotate configure tomcat logs rotation to monthly
#    and keep only 3 rotated
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access all app server. We are only showing application one server
ssh tony@stapp01
# install tomcat and logrotate
yum install -y tomcat logrotate
# start and enable tomcat service
systemctl start tomcat
systemctl enable tomcat
# access the path of logrotate configuration file
find /etc/ -type f -name logrotate.conf
# edit the logrotate config file
vi /etc/logrotate.conf
#varify the update using cat
cat /etc/logrotate.conf
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
## see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files monthly
monthly
# keep 3 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 3
# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create
# use date as a suffix of the rotated file
dateext
# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress
# RPM packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d
# system-specific logs may be also be configured here.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#Now configure the following file
vi /etc/logrotate.d/tomcat
# verify the content of file using cat
cat /etc/logrotate.d/tomcat
#------------------------------------------------
/{PATH_TO_CATALINA_FILE}/catalina*.* {
copytruncate
monthly
rotate 3

}
