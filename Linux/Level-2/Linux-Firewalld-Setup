# Problem Statement:
#
#To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to #install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx se#rvices running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Ap#ache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we#have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:
#
# 
#(a) Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port, i.e 80.
#(b) Block all incoming connections on Apache port, i.e 8080.
#(c) All rules must be permanent.
#(d) Zone should be public.
#(e) If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already,
#    please make sure to start them.
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access all the application servers using ssh. We are only showing
# solition for application server one
ssh tony@stapp01
#switch to the root user
sudo su -
#check the status of nginx and apache server
systemctl status nginx httpd
#install the firewall
yum install -y firewalld
#chek the status of firewalld
firewall-cmd --state
#start and enable firewalld
systemctl start firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld
#Add the rules as mentioned in the task
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
#restart the firewalld
systemctl restart firewalld
