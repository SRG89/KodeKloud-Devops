# Problem Statement:
#
#The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons 
#and want their data to be strictly accessed by the sysadmin group of the team.
#
#Setup a collaborative directory /sysadmin/data on app server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
#
#The directory should be group owned by the group sysadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory. 
#The directory should be read/write/execute to the user and group owners, and others should not have any access.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#access the application server 2 using ssh command.
ssh steve@stapp02
#switch to root user
sudo su -
# create collaborative directory
mkdir -p /sysadmin/data
# change group of the dir along with all files
chgrp sysadmin -R /sysadmin/data
# set the permission read/write/execute to the user and group owners, 
# and no permissions for others
chmod 770 /sysadmin/data
