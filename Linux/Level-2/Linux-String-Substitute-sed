# Problem Statement:
#
#There is some data on Nautilus App Server 3 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. 
#On Nautilus App Server 3, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:
#
#a. Delete all lines containing word code and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file.
#b. Replace all occurrence of word and to them and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.
#
#Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter 
#any words containing the string itself; for example upto, contributor etc.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to the application server three
ssh banner@stapp03
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#count the total occurance of string 'code' using cat and wc command
cat /home/BSD.txt | grep -o code | wc -l
#delete all lines containing string 'code' using sed command and save file
sed '/\<code\>/d' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_DELETE.txt
# again, count the oocurance of the string code in the new text file
cat /home/BSD_DELETE.txt | grep -o code | wc -l
# If the above command gives count 0 then it will confirm the deletion of code string
#count the total occurance of string 'and' using cat and wc command
cat /home/BSD.txt | grep -o and | wc -l
# replace all the occurance of string 'and' to 'them' using sed
sed 's/\band\b/them/g' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt
#again,count the occurance of string 'them' in the new file
cat home/BSD_REPLACE.txt | grep -o them | wc -l
#If total occurance of string 'them' in new file matches total occurance of string 'and'
#in old file then it will confirm the replacement of string and to them.
