# Problem Statement
#
#We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory 
#in the Apache web server document root. We want to password protect 
#http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per the following 
#requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since 
#there are no such specific requirements as of now).Setup the same on 
#App server 2 as per below mentioned requirements:
#
#
#
#
# a. We want to use basic authentication.
# b. We do not want to use htpasswd file based authentication.
#    Instead, we want to use PAM authentication, 
#    i.e Basic Auth + PAM so that we can authenticate with a Linux user.
# c. We already have a user rose with password B4zNgHA7Ya 
#    which you need to provide access to.
# d. You can test the same using a curl command from jump host 
#    curl http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access to application server 2
ssh steve@stapp02
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# install pwauth whichh is a unix authentication checking tool, 
# designed to be run by other programs that need to know 
# if a login/password combination is valid
yum --enablerepo=epel -y install mod_authnz_external pwauth 
# find the pwauth configuration file path
find /etc/ -type f -name authnz_external.conf
# configure the authnz_external.conf file
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf
# validate the content in the authnz_external.conf file
cat /etc/httpd/conf.d/authnz_external.conf
#--------------------------------------------------
#added lines within authnz_external.conf file
<Directory /var/www/html/protected>
AuthType Basic
AuthName "PAM Authentication"
AuthBasicProvider external
AuthExternal pwauth
require valid-user
</Directory>
#--------------------------------------------------
#
#restart the service
systemctl restart httpd
#validate the task by accessing content of app server
#from jump host using valid user
curl -u rose http://stapp02:8080/protected
#By providing the password for linux user rosa we can 
#access the secured web content
