# Problem Statement
#
#
# Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter.
# One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not 
# reachable on port 8088 (which is the Apache port). The service 
# itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something 
# else could be causing the issue.
#
#
#
# Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. 
# Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without 
# compromising any security settings.
# Once fixed, you can test the same using 
# command curl http://stapp01:8088 command from jump host.
#
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# ssh into application server one
ssh tony@stapp01
# valiate the status of httpd if not started please start it
systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd
# If apache fail to start verify the cause of failure using journalctl
journalctl -u httpd -f
#since journalctl mentioned the port unavailability as cause of failure
#verfiy service which is using the port allocated for httpd
netstat -nap | grep LISTEN
# since sendmail process is using the httpd port we need to kill
# sendmail process
pkill sendmail
#now restart the httpd again
systemctl restart httpd
#delete all iptables rule and allow ports if firewall has been set up
iptables -F
#From jump host try to access the content of apache server
curl http://stapp01:8088
