# Problem Statement
#
#
#The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version 
#of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on
#one#of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting,
#they have decided to use the tomcat application server.
#Based on the requirements menti# oned below complete the task:
#
#
#
#
# a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1.
# b. Configure it to run on port 8089.
# c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.
#
#
#Deploy it on this tomcat server & make sure the webpage works directly on base
#URL i.e curl http://stapp01:8089
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access to the application server one
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# install tomcat using yum
yum install -y tomcat
# configure the port of the tomcat
sed -i 's/8080/8089/g' /etc/tomcat/server.xml
# from jump host transfer the webfile
scp /tmp/ROOT.war tony@stapp01:/usr/share/tomcat/webapps
# start and enable tomcat
systemctl start tomcat
systemctl enable tomcat
# validate the tomcat installation and configuration by 
# accessing the content from jump host
curl http://stapp01:8089
