# Problem Statement:
#
# We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in 
# Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s 
# port i.e 3004 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these 
# hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and 
# after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following 
# requirements:
#
#
# 1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.
# 2. Block incoming port 3004 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
# 3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access all application serves. We are only showing solution
# for application server one.
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# install iptables services
yum install -y iptables-services
# add the rules as mentioned in the task
iptables -A INPUT -s 172.16.238.14 -p tcp --dport 3004 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3004 -j DROP
# save the rules in iptables
service iptables save
# start and enable iptables
systemctl start iptables && syatemctl enable iptables
#Need to perform this task on all apllication servers.
