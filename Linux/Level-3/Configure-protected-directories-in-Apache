# Problem Statement
#
#
#xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus 
#Application Servers in Stratos DC.There are some confidential directories 
#in the document root that need to be password protected. Since they are 
#using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has 
#decided to use .htaccess with basic auth.There is a website that needs to 
#be uploaded to /var/www/html/finance on Nautilus App Server 2. However, 
#we need to set up the authentication before that.
#
#
# 1. Create /var/www/html/finance direcotry if doesn't exist.
# 2. Add a user jim in htpasswd and set its password to BruCStnMT5.
# 3. There is a file /tmp/index.html present on Jump Server.Copy the 
#    same to the directory you created, please make sure default 
#    document root should remain /var/www/html. Also website should 
#    work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:8080/finance/
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
#
# access the spplaication server two
ssh steve@stapp02
# switch into root user
sudo su -
# create the .htpasswd file with authorized user and password.
# This file will be referenced with .htaccess file
htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd jim
# create directory as mentioned in the task
mkdir -p /var/www/html/finance
# create .htaccess file in the newly created directory 
vi /var/www/html/finance/.htaccess
# validate the content of the .htaccess file
cat /var/www/html/finance/.htaccess
#--------------------------------------
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Password Required"
Require valid-user
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
#----------------------------------------
#
#transfer the html file into the newly created directory from jump host
scp /tmp/index.html steve@stapp02:/var/www/html/finance
# restart the httpd server
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
# validate the task by accessing the web content from jump host
curl http://stapp02:8080/finance
#If above curl command get stopped from accessing the web content then 
#the we can say the web server is secure and accessible only for valid 
#user
curl -u jim http://stapp02:8080/finance
# This command will provide access to the website as jim is the valid user.
