# Problem Statement
#
# Nautilus system admin's team is planning to deploy a front end application 
# for their backup utility on Nautilus Backup Server, so that they can manage 
# the backups of different websites from a graphical user interface. They have 
# shared requirements to set up the same; please accomplish the tasks as per 
# detail given below:
#
#
#  a. Install Apache Server on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 
#  8085 port (do not bind it to 127.0.0.1 only, keep it default i.e let Apache
#  listen on server's IP, hostname, localhost, 127.0.0.1 etc).
#  b. Install Nginx webserver on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to 
#  use 8098.
#  c. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server for Apache.
#  d. There is a sample index file /home/thor/index.html on Jump Host, copy 
#  that file to Apache's document root.
#  e. Make sure to start Apache and Nginx services.
#  f. You can test final changes using curl command, 
#  e.g curl http://<backup server IP or Hostname>:8098
#
#
#  Solution Script
#
#  access to the backup server
ssh clint@stbkp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# install nginx and apache server 
yum install -y nginx httpd
#configure the port of httpd
sed -i 's/80/8085/g' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# change the port of the nginx server as well
sed -i 's/80/8098/g' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
#configure the nginx to set proxy pass
#
#
#---------------------------------------------
location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8085;
        }
#---------------------------------------------
#
# transfer the index file from jump host to the 
# bacup server
scp ~/index.html clint@stbkp01:/var/www/html
#start and enable the nginx and httpd server
systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
# validate task by accessing the content of file from jump host
curl http://stbkp01:8098
