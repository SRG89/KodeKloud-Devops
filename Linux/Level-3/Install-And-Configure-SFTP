# Problem Statement
#
#
# Some of the developers from Nautilus project team have asked for SFTP access to at least one of the app server in Stratos DC. 
# After going through the requirements, the system admins team has decided to configure the SFTP server on App Server 2 server 
# in Stratos Datacenter.Please configure it as per the following instructions:
#
#
# a. Create a SFTP user yousuf and set its password to LQfKeWWxWD. There is already a group called ftp, you can utilise the same.
# b. Password authentication should be enabled for this user.
# c. SFTP user should only be allowed to make SFTP connections.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
#
# access application server using ssh connection
ssh steve@stapp02
# change to root user
sudo su -
# Set up an SFTP directory and assign the permission
mkdir -p /data
chmod 701 /data
# Create an SFTP user and setup password
useradd yousuf -g ftp -s /sbin/nologin -d /yousuf
passwd yousuf
# Set up a new user SFTP directory 
mkdir -p /data/yousuf
chown -R root:ftp /data/yousuf
# Configure sshd 
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# validate the added content
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
