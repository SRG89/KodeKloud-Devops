# Problem Statement

# The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks 
# on different app servers in Stratos DC.Before that,some pre-requisites 
# must be met.Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH 
# connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes.One of 
# the tickets is assigned to you;please complete the task as per details 
# mentioned below:
#
# Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks# through thor user from jump host.
#
#
# There is an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump host.
# Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 3, 
# make sure ping works.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# Update/edit inventory file with following content
#
#
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Generate ssh key on jump_host server which is also our ansible controller
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
#
# Copy SSH key to setup password-less authentication to the host
ssh-copy-id banner@stapp03
