# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team wants to install and set up a simple httpd 
# web server on all app servers in Stratos DC.Additionally, they want 
# to deploy a sample web page for now using Ansible only.Therefore, 
# write the required playbook to complete this task.Find more details 
# about the task below.
#
# We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory 
# on jump host.Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory 
# on jump host itself.
#
# Using the playbook,install httpd web server on all app servers.
# Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.
#
#
# Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in 
# /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
#
# Welcome to XfusionCorp!
# This is  Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
# Please do not modify this file manually!
#
# The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should 
# be apache on all app servers.
#
# The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0777 on 
# all app servers.
