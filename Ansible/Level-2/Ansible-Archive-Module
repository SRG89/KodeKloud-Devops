# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team has some data on each app server in Stratos DC that 
# they want to copy to a different location.However,they want to create an 
# archive of the data first, then they want to copy the same to a different 
# location on the respective app server.Additionally,there are some specific 
# requirements for each server.Perform the task using Ansible playbook as 
# per requirements mentioned below:
#
#
# Create a playbook named playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory 
# on jump host, an inventory file is already placed under 
# /home/thor/ansible/ directory on Jump Server itself.
#
# Create an archive beta.tar.gz (make sure archive format is tar.gz) 
# of /usr/src/data/ directory ( present on each app server ) and copy 
# it to /opt/data/ directory on all app servers.The user and group owner 
# of archive beta.tar.gz should be tony for App Server 1, steve for 
# App Server 2 and banner for App Server 3.
