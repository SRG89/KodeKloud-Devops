# Probnlem Statement
#
# To manage all servers within the stack using Ansible,the Nautilus DevOps 
# team is planning to use a common sudo user among all servers.Ansible will 
# be able to use this to perform different tasks on each server.This is not 
# finalized yet, but the team has decided to first perform testing.
# The DevOps team has already installed Ansible on jump host using yum, 
# and they now have the following requirement:
#
# On jump host make appropriate changes so that Ansible can use ammar as 
# a default ssh user for all hosts.Make changes in Ansible's default 
# configuration only â€”please do not try to create a new config.
#
# edit the configuration file for ansible
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
# add remote_user under defaults setting
remote_user = ammar
# validate the task by getting 'ammar' as default ssh user
cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg | grep -o remote_user
