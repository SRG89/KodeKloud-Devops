# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple 
# httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC.They also want to deploy 
# a sample web page using Ansible.Therefore, write the required playbook 
# to complete this task as per details mentioned below.
#
# We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on 
# jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible 
# directory on jump host itself.Using the playbook perform below given tasks:
#
# Install httpd web server on all app servers,and make sure its service is 
# up and running.
#
# Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:
#
# This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
#
#
# Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in 
# /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
#
#
#------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Nautilus Group!
#
#
Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.
#
#
# The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner 
# should be apache on all app servers.
#
# The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 
# 0655 on all app servers.
