# Problem Statement
#
#
# Developers are looking for dependencies to be installed and run on 
# Nautilus app servers in Stratos DC.They have shared some requirements 
# with the DevOps team.Because we are now managing packages installation 
# and services management using Ansible,some playbooks need to be created 
# and tested.As per details mentioned below please complete the task:
#
#
# On jump host create an Ansible playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml 
# and configure it to install vsftpd on all app servers.
#
# After installation make sure to start and enable vsftpd service on all 
# app servers.
#
# The inventory /home/thor/ansible/inventory is already there on jump host.
#
# Make sure user thor should be able to run the playbook on jump host.
