# Problem Statement
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is practicing some of the Ansible modules and 
# creating and testing different Ansible playbooks to accomplish tasks.
# Recently they started testing an Ansible file module to create soft 
# links on all app servers. Below you can find more details about it.
#
# Write a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, 
# an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory 
# on jump host itself. Using this playbook accomplish below given tasks:
#
# Create an empty file /opt/dba/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner 
# and group owner should be tony.Create a symbolic link of source path 
# /opt/dba to destination /var/www/html.
#
# Create an empty file /opt/dba/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner 
# and group owner should be steve.Create a symbolic link of source path 
# /opt/dba to destination /var/www/html.
#
# Create an empty file /opt/dba/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner
# and group owner should be banner.Create a symbolic link of source path 
# /opt/dba to destination /var/www/html.
