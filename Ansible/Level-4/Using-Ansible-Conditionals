# Problem Statement
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team had a discussion about, how they can train different # team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks.There are numerous
# ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each 
# aspect that Ansible offers.The team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals 
# to perform the following task:
#
#
# An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible directory 
# on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included.
#
# Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to 
# use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the below given tasks.
#
#
# Copy blog.txt file present under /usr/src/sysops directory on jump host to 
# App Server 1 under /opt/sysops directory.Its user and group owner must 
# be user tony and its permissions must be 0655 .
#
# Copy story.txt file present under /usr/src/sysops directory on jump host 
# to App Server 2 under /opt/sysops directory.Its user and group owner must 
# be user steve and its permissions must be 0655 .
#
# Copy media.txt file present under /usr/src/sysops directory on jump host to 
# App Server 3 under /opt/sysops directory.Its user and group owner must 
# be user banner and its permissions must be 0655.
