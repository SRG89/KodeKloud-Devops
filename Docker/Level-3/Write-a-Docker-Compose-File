# Problem Statement
#
#The Nautilus application development team shared static website content 
#that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform.
#The team has shared details with the DevOps team,and we need to set up 
#an environment according to those guidelines.Below are the details:
#
#
#  a.On App Server 2 in Stratos DC create a container named 
#    httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml 
#     please use the exact name for file).
#   b.Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and 
#     make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.
#   c. Map 80 number port of container with port 8089 of docker host.
#   d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with 
#      /opt/devops volume of docker host which is already there.
#      (please do not modify any data within these locations).
#
#
# access application server 2
ssh steve@stapp02
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# change the directory as suggested in task
cd /opt/docker
# create a docker-compose file
vi docker-compose.yml
# list the content of compose file
cat docker-compose.yml
#----------------------------------------------
version: "3.0"
services:
  webapp:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "8089:80"
    volumes:
      - /opt/devops:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
#----------------------------------------------
#
# run the container using docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
# validate the task by listing docker image and file
docker images -a
docker ps -a
