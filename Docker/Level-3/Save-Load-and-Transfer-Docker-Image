# Problem Statement
#
#One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom 
#docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes 
#and image is saved on same server with name blog:devops.Recently a 
#requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, 
#but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3.So we need to 
#provide them th#at image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.
#
#
# a. On App Server 1 save the image blog:devops in an archive.
# b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.
# c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and 
#    tag which was used on App Server 1.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
#
#
# access application server one 
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user 
sudo su -
# save an image as an archive
docker save -o blog.tar blog:devops
# transfer an image archive to application server 3
scp ./blog.tar banner@stapp03:~
# access application server 3
ssh banner@stapp03
# switch to the root user 
sudo su -
# change to the home directory
cd /home/banner 
# load image archive on application server 3
docker load < /home/banner/blog.tar
# validate the task by listing all images 
docker images -a
