# Problem Statement
#
#
#The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, 
#which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments 
#soon.In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been 
#assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain 
#requirements.Below are more details:
#
#
# a.On App Server 3 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest 
#   tag but others should work too).
# b.Create a new container with name beta from the image you just pulled.
# c.Map the host volume /opt/sysops with container volume /tmp.
#   There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; 
#   copy that file to /opt/sysops.Also please keep the container 
#   in running state.
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access application server 3
ssh banner@stapp03
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# list the available images
docker images -a
# pull the nginx image with latest tag
docker pull nginx:latest
# create a container while mapping host volm
# with container volume
docker run -d --name beta -v /opt/sysops:/tmp nginx:latest
# copy the text file as mentioned in task
cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/sysops
# access the container using executive privilege
docker exec -it beta bash
# within a container check the copied file at 
# the mapped location
ls -l -h /tmp | grep sample.txt
# exit the container
exit
