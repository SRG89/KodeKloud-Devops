# Problem Statement 
#
#
#The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create new images per 
#requirements shared by the development team. One of the team 
#members is working to create a Dockerfile on App Server 2 in 
#Stratos DC.While working on it she ran into issues in which 
#the docker build is failing and displaying errors.Look into 
#the issue and fix it to build an image as per details mentioned below:
#
#
# a.The Dockerfile is placed on App Server 2 under /opt/docker directory.
# b.Fix the issues with this file and make sure it is able to build the image.
# c.Do not change base image, any other valid configuration within Dockerfile,
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access the application server 2
ssh steve@stapp02
#switch to root user
sudo su -
# change the directory as suggested in task
cd /opt/docker
# update the Dockerfile base on the error 
vi ./Dockerfile
cat ./Dockerfile
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#updated Dockerfile

# validate the task by bulding and listing the image
docker build -t webapp:lite .

#[Note: If the dockerfile is correctly updated we can build the image.In our case
#we name is webapp and tag with lite version]
