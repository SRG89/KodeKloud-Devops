# Problem Statement
#
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy one of the applications 
# on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.Due to a misconfiguration in the docker 
# compose file,the deployment is failing.We would like you to take a look 
# into it to identify and fix the issues.More details can be found below:
#
# a.docker-compose.yml file is present on App Server 1 under /opt/docker 
#   directory.
# b.Try to run the same and make sure it works fine.
# c.Please do not change the container names being used.
#   Also, do not update or alter any other valid config settings 
#   in the compose file or any other relevant data that can cause 
#   app failure.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
# access application server one 
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# change directory as suggested in question
cd /opt/docker
# move all file from app to current directory
mv ./app/* .
# update the docker-compose file and validate the fixed error
vi ./docker-compose.yml
cat ./docker-compose.yml
