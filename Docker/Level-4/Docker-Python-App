# Problem Statement
#
#
# A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be 
# deployed on App Server 1.We have already copied a requirements.txt 
# file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory 
# on App Server 1.Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:
#
# Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:
#
# Use any python image as the base image.
# Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
# Expose the port 8084.
# Run the server.py script using CMD.
# Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.
#
# Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:
# Map port 8084 of the container to the host port 8098.
# Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 1.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
#access to application server 1
ssh stapp01
#switch to root user
sudo su -
#change directory as instructed in task
cd /python_app
#copy all the content from sub direc to current dir
mv ./src/* .
#create a Dockerfile and verify the content
vi Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile
#---------------------------------------------
#
#make python image
FROM python:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8084
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
#----------------------------------------------
#
# Build docker image
docker build -t nautilus/python-app:latest .
# run docker image
docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8098:8084 nautilus/python-app:latest
# list the running container
docker ps
#validate the task by accessing the app content at mapped port
curl http://localhost:8098
