# Problem Statement
#
#
#The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development 
#of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform.
#The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some 
#of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment.
#The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before 
#going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker 
#compose fie. Below are the details of the task:
#
#
#
#On App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file 
#/opt/sysops/docker-compose.yml
#
#
#The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), 
#and each service should deploy a container as per details below:
#
#
#For web service:
#
#
# a. Container name must be php_web.
# b. Use image php with any apache tag.Check here for more details.
# c. Map php_blog container's port 80 with host port 5002
# d. Map php_blog container's /var/www/html volume with 
#    host volume /var/www/html.
#
#
For DB service:
#
#
# a. Container name must be mysql_web.
# b. Use image mariadb with any tag (preferably latest).
#    Check here for more details.
# c. Map mysql_blog container's port 3306 with host port 3306
# d. Map mysql_blog container's /var/lib/mysql volume with 
#    host volume /var/lib/mysql.
# e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_web and use any custom user
#    (except root) with some complex password for DB connections.
#
#
# Solution Script:
#
# access to application server 
ssh banner@stapp03
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# change directory as instructed in task
cd /opt/sysops/
# create yaml file as docker compose
vi docker-compose.yml
cat docker-compose.yml
#---------------------------------------
