# Problem Statement
#
# The Nautilus DevOps team has some confidential data present on 
# App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.There is a container 
# ubuntu_latest running on the same server. We received a request 
# to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. 
# Below are more details about the task:
#
#
# On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file 
# /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from docker host to ubuntu_latest container
# (running on same server) in /home/ location. Please do not try to 
# modify this file in any way.
#
#
# Solution Script
#
#
# access the application server 2
ssh steve@stapp02
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# list the running container
docker ps -a
# copy the docker host content to docker container
docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/home
# access docker container using iteractive terminal option
docker exec -it ubuntu_latest bash
# Within docker conteiner change directory
cd /home
# check the presence of copied file within docker container
ls -l -h | grep nautilus.txt.gpg
#exit the container
exit
