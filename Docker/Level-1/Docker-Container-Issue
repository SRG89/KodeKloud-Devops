# Problem Statement
#
# There is a static website running within a container named 
# nautilus, this container is running on App Server 1.Suddenly,
# we started facing some issues with the static website on App 
# Server 1. Look into the issue to fix the same, you can find 
# more details below:
#
#
# Container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is mapped with the 
# host's volume /var/www/html.
#
#
# The website should run on host port 8080 on App Server 1 
# i.e command curl http://localhost:8080/ should work on 
# App Server 1.
#
# Solution Script
#
# access application server 1
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# list all available images
docker images -a
# list all the containers
docker ps -a
# remove the containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a)
# create a container with specification per task
docker run -d --name nautilus -v /var/www/html:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs -p 8080:80 httpd:latest
# check the status of container
docker ps -a 
# validate the task by accessing the content of app within created container
curl http://localhost:8080
