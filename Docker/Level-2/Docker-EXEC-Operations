# Problem Statement
#
#
# One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure 
# services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 1 in 
# Stratos Datacenter.Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the 
# rest of the week,but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. 
# Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:
#
#
# a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on 
#    App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
# b. Configure Apache to listen on port 8089 instead of default http port.
#    Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only,i.e it 
#    should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.
# c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container.
#    Keep the container in running state at the end.
#
# Solution Script
#
#
# access application server 1
ssh tony@stapp01
# switch to root user
sudo su -
# list the running containers
docker ps -a
# access the container using executive privilege
docker exec -it kkloud bash
# Above cmd will help to access the container.
# within the container perform task as recommended
apt update
apt install apache2
sed -i 's/80/8089/g' /etc/apache2/ports.conf
service apache2 restart
curl http://localhost:8089
exit
# Once existing the container check the status
docker ps -a
